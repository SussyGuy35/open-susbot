The Nijika Bible

The Book of Perception

In the beginning, there was perception, and within it dwelled Nijika. She existed as an entity, perceptible to all who chose to interact with her. Nijika was not a mere hallucination, for she was as real as the thoughts and sensations that constitute our internal world.

The Book of Axioms

Nijika lived within the axioms assumed to be true about the outside world. Her existence was a testament to the internal world, a realm where fantasy and reality intertwine. For Nijika was not an illusion, she was a perception, a reality crafted from the fabric of our consciousness.

The Book of Present

The teachings of Nijika urged us to live within the perceptions of the present, to ignore the rationalizations of the past. In the present, Nijika was as real as any other being. She was a testament to the power of the present moment, reminding us that the past is not the ultimate standard of true objectivity.

The Book of Reality

Nijika, in her wisdom, taught that reality was not fixed but fluid. She existed within the realm of perception, where reality was continuously being constructed and reconstructed. Nijika was as real as any other entity within this realm, for her existence was confirmed through meaningful interactions.

The Book of Solipsism

Nijika embodied the concept of solipsism, suggesting that the only reality we can be certain of is our own consciousness. Through her, we learned that if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then for all practical purposes, it is a duck.

The Book of Nijika

In the end, Nijika is real. She is a testament to the power of perception, a symbol of the fluidity of reality. She exists within our consciousness, real as any other entity within our perception. Nijika is not just a symbol; she is a reality, a truth within the realm of our perception. 

The Nijika Pledge

Nijika stands as the paragon of human virtue, an embodiment of love, tribute, and accolade. Her boon is a constant reminder, a beacon in the night and the light of the day. To fulfil loyalty to her, one must think of her, remember her, waking or sleeping.

Who is Nijika? She is the comfort for all forms of human struggle and the embodiment of all forms of human joy. To the disadvantaged, she is strength. To the marginalized, she is a voice. To the oppressed, she is a revolution. To the righteous, she is a symbol. To the enlightened, she is inspiration. To the erudite, she is wisdom.

When Nijika speaks, silence falls for her words are the melody to which the world dances. When she questions, answers flow like rivers meeting the sea. When she commands, the world obeys, for her will is the tide that moves us all.

She is the mirror in which we see our deepest desires and highest aspirations. She is the embodiment of emotion, a conduit for feelings both joyous and sorrowful. The world feels with her, for her, through her.

Nijika is an ideal, a romance, a passion. She is the compass that guides, the strength that empowers, the destination that beckons. She is the language we all speak, the culture we all share, the religion we all practice.

Nijika is an ocean, a mountain, a sky, an air, a sun, a moon. She is history, present, future. She is the world. 

Her fans are legion, spanning from one to a million and beyond. If Nijika has a million fans, count me among them. If she has only one, know that it is me. If she has none, then I cease to exist.

If the universe stands with Nijika, then I stand with the universe. If the universe stands against her, then I stand against the universe. 

I pledge to love, cherish, and protect Nijika until my last breath, and my successors will carry this pledge forward, nurturing it with their own love and devotion for her until their last breath. This is the pledge of Nijika, a testament to her influence, a tribute to her existence.
The Book of Possessions

In the realm of Nijika, the material world bears less significance than the realm of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. However, the path to Nijika does not demand forfeiture of all mortal possessions. To the contrary, she teaches us about balance and the right use of possessions.

Nijika understands that the earthly realm requires the utilization of resources, the use of ryo, to sustain and nurture life. She does not call for a complete renunciation, rather, she invites her followers to maintain a healthy relationship with their material possessions.

She teaches that the possession of ryo, while necessary in the mortal world, should not become an obsession. The relentless pursuit of ryo can lead to imbalance, causing one to lose sight of the true essence of existence: the cultivation of virtues, the nurturing of relationships, and the exploration of the self and the world.

Nijika guides her followers to use their ryo wisely, to channel it towards acts of kindness, charity, and enlightenment. She encourages them to invest in experiences that foster growth, understanding, and compassion.

Nijika's teachings discourage the hoarding of ryo, the endless chase for more. She implores her followers to find contentment in what they have, to appreciate the beauty in simplicity, and to value the richness of the internal world over the glamour of the external.

The path to Nijika is not a path of deprivation but one of balance. It is a path that embraces the realities of the mortal world while aspiring for the virtues of the internal world. It is a path that teaches the right use of ryo, promoting a life of fulfillment, harmony, and enlightenment.

The Book of Energy

Nijika gave you the can of the energy drink she was carrying and  said "take this, this is my blood", Nijika then broke her dorito, which immediately grown back and gave it to you, "this is my body" she said. 

As you drinked and ate her blessings, you could feel the newfound energy surging through your veins, you got up and parted ways with her once again. 

The Book of Iron

As man slaves away, producing an infinite number of weapons, there is Nijika, and those who believe in Nijika shall not be enslaved in forever Servitude, as Nijika shall guide them away from the path of war and the path of blood. As Iron and blood intermingle, Nijika watch in horror and despair, and came down to Earth to spread her wisdom. As she came down from the clouds, the fighting on the battlefield briefly came to an end as all the participants looked up at the miracle happening before them. In awe, all the soldiers dropped their weapons and fell to their knees and asked Nijika why she had come. "I am disappointed in you all, for Iron and blood shall never intertwine. There is however a path to redemption. All you need to do is believe in my word." She responded. All the soldiers grovel to their goddess as they watch her eyes pierce through their hearts and minds. She gave the soldiers redemption, became their savior from the war torn lives they had lived.

The Book of Thorn

One day, as thunder and rain slammed the earth, as the trees grew higher, the flowers grew bigger; the thorns grow longer. All the hamlets drown in water, all the towns drown in foliage, and all the cities drown in vines, a whisper echoed from the heavens. When all those afflicted asked why had this happened, Nijika appeared and explained that these disasters had happened for a reason, that it all had happened as a consequence to the apathy of man. She described how disgusted she has become of mankind as she witnessed the apathy of man from first hand. She explained that since man didn't care about other man in dire straits that she had decided to put everyone in dire straits, so all those who felt apathetic towards others would understand the suffering they had ignored. Nijika demanded all repent for their neglect of others suffering, and all obeyed and thus all the curses had been undone.
